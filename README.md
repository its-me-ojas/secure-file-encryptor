### Steps taken to develop this webapp

1. **Research Encryption Algorithms:**
   Explore different encryption algorithms like AES, RSA, or others. Choose one that suits your project's goals.

2. **Set Up Your Rust Environment:**
   Make sure you have Rust installed. You can use `rustup` for this. Once installed, create a new Rust project with `cargo new secure_file_encryptor`.

3. **Implement File Input/Output:**
   Start with basic file handling in Rust. Learn how to read and write files. This will be crucial for your encryption tool.

4. **Implement Encryption Algorithm:**
   Write functions to encrypt and decrypt files using the chosen algorithm. You might want to create a separate module for this.

5. **Key Management:**
   Develop a system for managing encryption keys. It could be password-based or involve public-private key pairs, depending on the algorithm.

6. **User Interface (Optional):**
   Consider adding a simple command-line interface or even a basic graphical interface to make your tool user-friendly.

7. **Error Handling:**
   Implement robust error handling to ensure your program gracefully handles unexpected situations.

8. **Testing:**
   Test your encryption tool with various file types and sizes to ensure it works reliably.

9. **Documentation:**
   Document your code. This includes inline comments and a README file explaining how to use your tool.

10. **Security Review:**
    Given your involvement in OWASP, consider conducting a security review of your code. Look out for potential vulnerabilities and ensure best practices are followed.

11. **Version Control:**
    Use Git for version control. It will help you track changes, collaborate with others, and easily roll back if needed.

12. **Community Involvement:**
    Since you're a core member of the OWASP society, consider sharing your project with the community. Feedback can be valuable for improvement.
